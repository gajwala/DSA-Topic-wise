## How to use

- Pick a question, read the `.md` file for requirements and approach.
- Implement in a fresh React app (Vite/CRA) without looking at the solution section until you’re done.
- Time yourself (e.g. 45–60 min) to simulate the round.

## Concepts commonly tested

- **State:** useState, useReducer, lifting state, derived state.
- **Effects:** useEffect (sync, cleanup), dependency array.
- **Lists:** keys, conditional render, map/filter.
- **Forms:** controlled inputs, validation, submit.
- **Composition:** children, render props, compound components.
- **Performance:** debounce, memo, keys; virtualization if needed.
- **Persistence:** localStorage, URL state.
- **Accessibility:** labels, focus, keyboard (where asked).
